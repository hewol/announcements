Hello everyone! Today we are share that we are now experimenting with dark mode in hewol website, also other things to share as well!

This is our 2nd version of the hewol website with some fixes and changes.

### Things fixed
* Image cropping issue (only fixed on mobile)
* Slow loading times
* Ugly White Mode and no dark mode :D

### Things changed
* New dark mode
* Changed the aerOS picture

So this is what old website looks like:

Also the arch scripts picture blends well with the background, also you might see a text in a bottom saying "Website Hosted on Github" , it is there to tell the user who is visiting the website that this website is hosted on Github. Anyways the new dark mode website is now uploaded and ready to be visited! https://hewol.github.io/
