# Experimenting with dark mode in Hewol website
#### XanuduBuster - 16/6/2023

Hello everyone! Today we are sharing our experimentation with dark mode in the Hewol website, also other things to share as well!

This is our 2nd version of the Hewol website with some fixes and changes.

### Things fixed
* Image cropping issue (only fixed on mobile)
* Slow loading times
* Ugly light mode and no dark mode :D

### Things changed
* New dark mode
* Changed the aerOS picture

So this is what the old website looked like:

### A complete change!

This idea was made by our new dev @MaxomiYT and he codes very well in html and css!
It was his idea to bring dark mode to our Hewol website also with some changes like changing the aerOS picture

Old Website:
![ew](https://github.com/hewol/announcements/assets/133562760/2264fc95-bf23-4ab2-9432-b8f057ae6e8c)

New Website:

Also the arch scripts picture blends well with the background, also you might see a text at the bottom saying "Website Hosted on GitHub", it is there to tell the user who is visiting the website that this website is hosted on GitHub. Anyways the new dark mode website is now uploaded and ready to be visited! https://hewol.github.io/
