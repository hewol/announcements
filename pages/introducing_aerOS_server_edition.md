# Introducing aerOS Server Edition
#### debarkak - 2/7/2023

Hello everyone! It's been a long time since we written an announcement in GitHub Markdown Readme... But we are here to announce the new edition of aerOS named *aerOS Server Edition*!


### What is the difference?

1. aerOS Server Edition doesn't have a GUI
2. aerOS Server Edition uses a script-based installer, while aerOS uses a GUI Installer called calamares.
3. aerOS Server Edition is much more stable than normal aerOS as it does not have to deal with any GUI dependencies, and has less things included
4. Instead of each version getting one year of support on normal aerOS, it will get one year for support of beta releases and two years for support of stable releases.
5. aerOS Server Edition doesn't have 3rd party repos like `packages-aeros` , `alg-repo` and `chaotic-aur`
6. 3rd party package managers like `flatpak` and `yay` are not preinstalled
7. aerOS Server Edition will have less customization.
