# Story and Updates on Hewol (2024)
#### debarkak - 1/5/2024

Hewol is been silent for a while... But in the media, behind the scene we're working on new aerOS release however other Hewol projects just left abandond as we don't have much interest in the other projects but in aerOS mostly luna is working on aerOS and not me or other people, that's because in aerOS so many new things added, so much that I can't work in aerOS because of so many things that I don't know what to do next, but I don't have he time to learn on GNOME developement or manage all Hewol social media accounts or even mine, I just make the To-Do list for luna to work on aerOS while Danek309044 is working at Hewol but mostly at Hewol Website's, GitHub Repo's and Discord Server. While me on the other hand, I am not doing much on Hewol as I was in 2023. Hewol was started on May 10th 2023, and the first aerOS was released at exactly 12:00AM IST 27th May 2023 a.k.a When my birthday started, however the files were uploaded few hours before release, but the aerOS project started on 14th May 2023. Back then I was developing alot on Hewol with my cousin brother (Preetam-Das), however that time his college exams came and he decided to leave Hewol, he said he will come back later however he didn't, after I talked with him, he said he will never join. Though he forgot alot about Arch Linux and archiso after all his exams. He is now a Raspberry Pi guy. Now don't think we will port aerOS to arm64, especially Raspberry Pi (Broadcom-based Devices). Anyways I talked about that I don't have the time to manage or learn things about new things in aerOS or even no time to manage my own projects, Well that's because of school's and exams and chores. Remember, I am a 13 (13 as the time I am writing this) Year old who tried lots of things but then fails, and recently my mental health is damaged by lots of Telegram Users and some of my bully's in school, whom trying to false complain to my parents, trying to get me grounded, because of this I don't have the time, the energy to develop things on aerOS or other Hewol Projects or even my project's! The thing is I am the only one who manage all Hewol social media accounts, and since I don't have time to do this, I gave Danek309044 the role of Co Owner of Hewol. But I will still stay as an owner and have little bit of time to look at new things developed in Hewol. But for now, I will stay hiatus 75% for few years, I might be free after school ends but given the fact I am in class7 and last class is class12, if you do the calculations then that means I have 5 more years of school, So I might be inactive 7% for 5 years or more if I go to college. For now most projects and social media's of Hewol will be managed by other people in the Hewol Team, I will do some if I have a little bit of time. Note: Hewol might change this year because as I won't be present alot, other people will develop with their plans, But for now, Bye.
