# Switching Language in OpenBot
#### debarkak - 28/9/2023

Well, it has been a long time since I wrote an announcement, but let's just say that I am tired now due to exams, but exams are now finished and I started to work, but due to Danek309044 leaving Hewol, as a matter of fact, the Hewol website and OpenBot development is very much struggling, I could work on those projects myself, but what about aerOS? What about archscripts? These projects were dead for a long time and I still didn't get systemd to load in **future aerOS ESB9** release which me, and luna have been debugging for a long time, however since luna does not know node.js and will never learn node.js, and since Preetam Das and luna are great Python developers, i just was thinking to switch from node.js to python, luna did tell me if i could switch it then he could work on it, also while decisions another guy Dominik K. or the creator of "would you bot" made a contribution, that was our first contribution who was not at the Hewol team, then Xanudu invited to the Hewol team, Dominik accepted first however later he was behaving more like 'idc just leave me alone' vibes, that time we did not leave him alone until he did leave himself, i was a former "would you bot" user when i used to own a Minecraft server Discord server in 2021, one thing i noticed that Dominik was very much pushing us to use their template, with 'the big green button', basically they want us to delete our repo and use their template, which also adds a text that we're using this template, we wanted to start this from scratch but thats what Dominik was not letting us to do that, until we decided to just block him and forget about it. It was at this point OpenBot just died off... Danek309044 left cuz Hewol wanted a lot of resources from him, but after that all devs we have are python devs, no node.js devs, I am the only node.js dev at the Hewol team, but since I am more focused into aerOS and other main projects right now, that i will have to let Preetam Das, Xanudu , AVVERSION and luna to work on it, so i made the final decision to change the language of OpenBot from node.js/discord.js to Python, for sure you will never see any more contributions/commits in OpenBot from me (except readme.md ofc), this might be the longest thing i wrote (jk).

  **Changes will take effect on October 15 2023** https://github.com/hewol/OpenBot
