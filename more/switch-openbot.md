# Switching Language in OpenBot
### Written by [debarkak](https://github.com/debarkak)

well its been a long time since i wrote a announcement, but lets just say that i am tired now due to exams, but exams finished and i started to work, but due to [Danek309044](https://github.com/Danek309044) rage leaving hewol, as a matter of fact, the hewol website and openbot developement is very much struggling, i could work those projects myself, but what about aerOS? what about archscripts? those projects is dead long time and i still did not get the systemd to load in **future aerOS esb9** release which me and [lun4h](https://github.com/piotr25691) have been debugging for a long time, however since lun4h does not know node.js and will never learn node.js, and since [Preetam Das](https://github.com/Preetam-Das) and lun4h are great python developers, i just was thinking to switch from node.js to python, lun4h did tell me if i could switch it then he can work on it, also while decisions another guy [Dominik K.](https://github.com/mezotv) or the creator of "would you bot" made a contribution, that was our first contributioon who was not at the hewol team, then [Xanudu](https://github.com/XanuduBuster) invited to the hewol team, domink accepted first however later he was behaving more like 'idc just leave me alone' vibes, that time we did not leave him alone until he did leave himself, i was a former "would you bot" user when i used to own a minecraft server discord server in 2021, 1 thing i noticed that dominik was very pushing us to use their template, with 'the big green button', basically they want us to delete our repo and use their template, which also adds that we using this template, we wanted to start this at scratch but thats what dominik wont letting us do that, until we decided to just block him and forget about it, it was at this point openbot just died off... Danek309044 rage left cuz hewol and me are indian and he is rage left because of tech support scam, we all know that but try we try to avoid it as best as possible, but after that all devs we have are python dev's, no node.js devs, i am the only node.js dev at the hewol team, but since i am more focused into aerOS and other main projects now, that i will have to let Preetam Das and lun4h to work on it, so i made the final decision to change the language of openbot from node.js/discord.js to python, for sure you will never see any more contributions/commits in openbot from me (except readme.md ofc). also this might the longest thing i wrote (jk).
